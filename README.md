# EXT-Bring

This is a module for the [MagicMirrorÂ²](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror/).

*The module is not released by the bring! company*

Displays Your Bring! List in a table view on your mirror.

The refresh interval is 30 Seconds.

You need to create a email/password account on the website to use this module.

Just use the "create magic link" function in the app, use it to login to the website on a laptop or desktop comupter and create a emailadress/passowrd login.

The module was created using the REST api they use on their web site by reverse engineering it.

It is absolutely unsupported by the bring team.

If they change their API it will probably break the module. So use it at your own Risk.

## Install guide

login to your rapberry pi, cd into the modules folder and execute

npm install
